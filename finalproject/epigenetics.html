		What is epigenetics and how does it affect the future generations?<br>
		</h2>
            <p style="font-size: .8em;"> The definition of epigenetics is 'the study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression 
                rather than alteration of the genetic code itself'.

                <summary>Epigenetics Controls Genes</summary>
                <p>Certain circumstances in life can cause genes to be silenced or expressed over time. In other words, they 
                can be turned off (becoming dormant) or turned on (becoming active).</p>

                <summary>Epigenetics Is Everywhere</summary> 
                <p>What you eat, where you live, who you interact with, when you sleep, how you exercise, even aging – all of 
                these can eventually cause chemical modifications around the genes that will turn those genes on or off over time. Additionally, in 
                certain diseases such as cancer or Alzheimer’s, various genes will be switched into the opposite state, away from the normal/healthy state.</p>

                <summary>Epigenetics Makes Us Unique</summary> 
                <p>Even though we are all human, why do some of us have blonde hair or darker skin? Why do some of us hate 
                the taste of mushrooms or eggplants? Why are some of us more sociable than others? The different combinations of genes that are turned on or 
                off is what makes each one of us unique. Furthermore, there have been indications that some epigenetic changes can be inherited.</p>

                <summary>Epigenetics Is Reversible</summary> 
                <p>With 20,000+ genes, what will be the result of the different combinations of genes being turned on or off? The 
                possible arrangements are enormous! But if we could map every single cause and effect of the different combinations, and if we could reverse the 
                gene’s state to keep the good while eliminating the bad… then we could theoretically* cure cancer, slow aging, stop obesity, and so much more.</p>
